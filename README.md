# Hotstar Content Classification using KNN

## Overview
This capstone project aims to classify Hotstar content based on its features using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The dataset consists of various content types, genres, viewer engagement metrics, and metadata.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Hotstar dataset from Kaggle
- **Features:** Content ID, Title, Genre, running_time, episodes,seasons etc.
- **Target Variable:** Content classification labels (e.g., Movie, TV Show, Sports, Kids)

## Algorithm
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Works by comparing feature similarities and assigning labels based on the most common nearest neighbors.
- Distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results & Insights
- Initial accuracy: 86% on test data
- Content classification helps improve recommendation algorithms.
- Genre-based clustering shows user preferences effectively
